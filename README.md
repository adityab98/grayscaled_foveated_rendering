## Abstract

Cloud gaming allows users without powerful systems
to play high-end games. However, these platforms make a
fundamentally wrong assumption. That is, that the users care in
any significant way about the quality of the game. Cloud gaming

is not worth the hassle for an affluent user. For average, mid-
end users however, cloud gaming is a door to another world.

Using cloud gaming, these users can play extremely high-end
games that they never could have otherwise. This leads to an
important conclusion - those who use cloud gaming services seek
nothing more than to be able to play a game. Graphics and
eye-candy is a completely different matter altogether. In this
vein, it is important to minimize the latency and maximize the
responsiveness and playability of the game. Ensuring that a game
is streamed with as low delay as possible and ensuring that the
user can play the game as smoothly as possible should be the two
fundamental goals of this platform. It is thus very important to
work on the rendering engines that make up the game and the
encoders which capture the game screen. Foveation along with
grayscaling is a viable means to reduce latency and data sizes.

This project is a proof-of-concept of gray-scaled foveation.
It shows that using foveation on top of grayscaling might be a serious,
viable possibility in order to reduce latency in cloud-gaming.
With future developments of graphics, video game engines, and video
codecs, it may be possible to bifurcate color processing. A system
where a majority of the graphics power is used to only render 255 colours
instead of the current 16,777,216 is one where cloud gaming is a real,
viable alternative to regular gaming systems.
